# ask

A command line app which queries the Wikipedia API.

I wrote this program as an exercise to learn more about Clojure. It most certainly has bugs, and is not intended to be used in any production like environment. 

## Installation

    $ lein uberjar

## Usage

Create a small shell script wrapper to run from the command line, example:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

query="$1"
java -jar path/to/ask/target/uberjar/ask-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar "$query"
```
